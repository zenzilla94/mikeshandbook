A major differentiator between Zettlekasten and traditional note-taking is the how you create the note.

Traditionally when you are learning something new, you are focused on taking notes to study later.

With zettlekasten, instead of blindly coping down information, you make the effort to devolop a critical understanding of the subject before writing down your analysis.

The benefit of this is a fully developed idea that can be referenced in the future.
